# Code for "A Federated Learning Framework Based on Differential Privacy Continuous Data Release"

The project is the code for the paper **"A Federated Learning Framework Based on Differential Privacy Continuous Data Release"**. The authors are Jianping Cai, Ximeng Liu*

In this project, we design a Federated learning (FL) framework FL-DPCR. The framework introduces differential privacy continuous data release (DPCR) to construct parameter models, which significantly reduces the accumulation of noise on parameter models, thus improves the learning accuracy.

The project integrates our designed [**Opacus-DPCR**](https://github.com/imcjp/Opacus-DPCR) to implement FL with DPCR. For more details, please see our [**Github Project**](https://github.com/imcjp/Opacus-DPCR).
